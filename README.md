# Store Application 

This is a simple RESTful API for a store system that I built as a backend project. The idea was to cover all core e-commerce flows like user registration, login, product listing, cart management, and placing orders. Everything is built from scratch using Java and Spring Boot.

---

## What It Does ‚úÖ

- User can register and log in (passwords are stored securely)
- Products are listed with stock info and price
- Users can:
    - Add products to a cart
    - View and update their cart
    - Remove items if needed
- Checkout flow validates stock before creating the order
- Session-based cart ‚Äì tied to login
- Also planned (optional):
    - Password reset
    - Cancel order
    - View all past orders

## Environment Setup üß™

- Java 17+
- Docker (for PostgreSQL container)
- Postgres running locally on `localhost:5432`
- `application.yml` with DB credentials

Example `application.yml`:
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/store_db
    username: your_db_user
    password: your_db_password
```


## Running the Project üöÄ

1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/store-app.git
cd store-app
```
2. Start PostgreSQL using Docker
```bash
docker run --name store-db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=store_db \
  -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

3. Run the Application
 ```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
