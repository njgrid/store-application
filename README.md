# Store Application 

This is a simple RESTful API for a store system that I built as a backend project. The idea was to cover all core e-commerce flows like user registration, login, product listing, cart management, and placing orders. Everything is built from scratch using Java and Spring Boot.

## What It Does ‚úÖ

- User can register and log in (passwords are stored securely)
- Products are listed with stock info and price
- Users can:
    - Add products to a cart
    - View and update their cart
    - Remove items if needed
- Checkout flow validates stock before creating the order
- Session-based cart ‚Äì tied to login
- Also planned (optional):
    - Password reset
    - Cancel order
    - View all past orders
